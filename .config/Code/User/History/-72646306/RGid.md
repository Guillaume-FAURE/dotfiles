## Introduction : Form of a sentence

Classical : Subject verb person/nominal group
_ex: J'aime les chats_ == I like cats

## Subject

There is three type of subject : Pronoun, Person, Nominal group

### Pronoun

Singular:

-   1st : Je == I
-   2nd : Tu == You
-   3rd : Il/Elle/On == He/She (We)
    Plural :
-   1st : Nous == We
-   2nd : Vous == You
-   3rd : Ils/Elles == They

With the verb **aimer** which means love:

#### Example

J'aime _ Here Je become J' because aimer begin with a vowel
T'aimes / Tu aimes _ Same for Tu but keeping Tu aimes is allowed
Il aime ; Elle aime ; On aime
Nous aimons
Vous aimez
Ils aiment ; Elles aiment

### Person

Usually, the persons are designed by their name. Let's take the name Yuki with the verb **aimer**
_ex: Yuki aime les chats_ == Yuki likes cats
With multiple names, it becomes plural.
_ex: Yuki et Guillaume aiment les chats == Yuki and Guillaume like cats_

### Nominal group

A nominal group or **Groupe nominal** in french are composed by determinant and noun

#### Determinant

Determinants will define a relation between the environment and the noun.

##### Ex:

-   une chaise == a chair ==> There is multiple chair and it's one of them
-   la chaise == the chair ==> This is the only chair or at least the only important one
-   sa chaise == his chair ==> This the chair of the previous subject of the sentence.
    Here we can see that the determinant add a new information.

##### Indefinite article

The indefinite articles or **articles indéfinis** in french are determinant used to call a non-specific noun.
3 articles:

-   un == a/an (for male word)
-   une == a/an (for female word)
-   des == ø (for plural)

###### Ex:

-   un chat = a cat
-   une chatte = a female cat
-   des chats = some cats

##### Definite article

The definite articles or **articles définis** in french are determinant used to call a specific noun.
3 articles:

-   le == the (for male word)
-   la == the (for female word)
-   les == the (for plural)

###### Ex:

-   le chat = the cat
-   la chatte = the female cat
-   les chats = the cats
    Here we always talk about known cats.

We'll see more determinants later, these are the most important and used.

#### Noun

Nouns or **noms communs** in french are used to define everything except persons (For them we use name or **noms propres** in french).
Each nouns have a gender and can be singular or plural.

##### Ex:

un chat- male noun: cat;
une guitare- female noun: guitar;
un manga- male noun: manga;
un oeil- male noun: eye;
un cheveu- male noun: hair;
une pâte- female noun: pasta;

## Verb

The verbs or **verbes** in french are use to define actions.
There is 3 groups of verbs:

### 1st group

The verb of the 1st group all finish in **_er_**

#### Ex:

-   manger = to eat
-   aimer = to love
-   marcher = to walk
-   laver = to wash

WARNING! there is some exception with the most known one, go, **aller** in french, is of the third group.

### 2nd group

The verb of the 2nd group all finish in **_ir_**

#### Ex:

-   finir = to finish
-   lire = to read
-   rire = to laugh

WARNING! all the verb of the 2nd group finish in **_ir_** but not all the verb that finish in **_ir_** are in the 2nd group, a lot of them are of the 3rd group.

### 3rd group

All the other verb with all the exception, most annoying one because their grammar is not stable

#### Ex:
- joindre = to join
- servir = to serve
- pondre = to lay
